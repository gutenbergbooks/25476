<h2><a name="How_Horatius_Kept_the_Bridge" id="How_Horatius_Kept_the_Bridge"></a>How Horatius Kept the Bridge</h2>


<p>More than two thousand years ago Rome was ruled
over by some kings called the Tarquins. As they
were wicked men, the Roman people rose up against
them, and drove them out of the city. The banished
kings then went to Tuscany, where Lars Porsena took
up their cause, and gathering an army together, went
to help them force an entrance into Rome again.</p>

<span class="caption">HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE</span>
</div>

<p>The city could only be entered by crossing the river
Tiber, and there was but one wooden bridge over which
the army could pass. Then the leader of the Romans,
who was called the Consul, cried out to his followers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>to destroy the bridge.</p>

<p>"But," he added sadly, "I fear they will be upon us
before we have time to hew it down."</p>

<p>At this a Roman called Horatius came forward and
offered to stand at the farther end of the bridge, to keep
the Tuscans at bay while it was being destroyed.</p>

<p>"The pathway is so narrow," said he, "that if two
others will help me, we can stop the whole army from
advancing. So who will keep the bridge with me?"</p>

<p>Two other brave Romans, called Spurius Lartius and
Titus Herminius, at once answered the call of their
comrade, and these three gallant men went to defend the
passage, while the rest hastened to destroy the bridge.</p>

<p>When the Tuscans saw the three men standing ready
to meet the whole army, they laughed aloud in scorn.
But their laughter was soon changed to wrath and despair,
as one after the other they and their chiefs were quickly
laid low at the feet of the dauntless Romans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the supports of the bridge were destroyed.
The Consul shouted to the three heroes to hasten across
before the ruin fell into the water beneath. Lartius and
Herminius just succeeded in getting safely to the farther
bank, but Horatius remained facing the foe until the last
beam fell. Then with a cry he leapt into the foaming
stream, and although badly wounded and heavy with his
armour, he managed to rejoin his comrades on dry land,
to the joy of the whole city. During his gallant fight,
a dart from an enemy's arrow had put out one eye, and
because of this he was given the surname of Cocles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>which means one-eyed.</p>

</div>
<p>When the Emperor Albert ruled over Germany,
he wished to govern the people of Switzerland
in such a way that their independent spirit would be
broken. To bring about this end he appointed a
governor, who treated the Swiss unjustly and cruelly.</p>

<p>The name of this man was Gessler, and in order to
test the people's obedience, he placed his hat upon a pole
in the market square of one of the principal towns, and
commanded that all who passed it should bow down before
it in token of respect. A certain brave Swiss, named
William Tell, having refused to obey such an absurd
order, was at once arrested and taken before Gessler.
The tyrant, who knew him to be a clever archer, said that
his life would be spared only on the condition that he
should with an arrow hit an apple placed upon the head
of his only son. Tell's eye was true, so he consented
to the horrible proposal.</p>

<p>An apple having been placed upon the head of his
little son, he took his bow and quiver, and prepared to
take aim. A moment later the apple, split in two halves,
fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Gessler, who was enraged at Tell's success, noticed
that he carried another arrow under his cloak.</p>

<p>"What have you a second arrow for?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"If I had killed my boy," replied the bold Swiss,
"the second arrow was for you."</p>

<p>The angry governor had him thrown into prison, but
Tell escaped, and revenged himself by killing the tyrant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>When King James came to the throne of Scotland,
the whole country was in a state of rebellion.</p>

<p>The King tried to restore order, but the wicked nobles
hated him, and plotted together to take his life.</p>

<p>It was Christmas, and King James, with his Queen
Joan and a party of faithful friends, was celebrating the
season at an old monastery in Perth. The day had passed
merrily, and the royal couple prepared to retire.</p>

<p>Suddenly the clang of arms was heard. The ladies
rushed to secure the door of the room, but alas! the bolts
and bars had gone, and only the empty staples remained.
Meanwhile King James seized the tongs, and tearing up
a board in the floor, let himself down into a vault below.
But before there was time to replace the board, the murderers
came rushing along. Then Catherine Douglas,
one of the Queen's ladies, flew to the door and thrust
her arm through the empty staples, thus gaining time
to allow her sovereign to escape. The brave arm was
but a frail bar, and was soon broken, and the traitors
burst into the room, to find no sign of King James.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the King was unable to get out of the
vault. The ladies then made ropes of the sheets, and
tried to pull him up, but the noise was heard by the
ruffians. They again rushed into the room and the unfortunate
monarch was most cruelly murdered.</p>

<p>Although Catherine's brave deed was not rewarded by
the salvation of her King's life, yet it was an act of self-sacrifice
which places her among the ranks of true heroines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Casabianca" id="Casabianca"></a>Casabianca</h2>


<p>The Battle of the Nile was a great battle fought at
sea between the British and French in the year 1798.
The famous admiral, Lord Nelson, was in command of
the British fleet, and he won a most glorious victory in
which only four French ships escaped.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 289px;">

<span class="caption">CASABIANCA ON THE BURNING SHIP</span>
</div>
<p>Towards the close of the battle the French Admiral's
flagship, <i>L'Orient</i>, caught fire, and blazed up with terrible
brightness. Lord Nelson immediately gave orders that
the British boats should be put off to save as many
as possible of the poor sailors on the burning vessel.</p>

<p>When the boats reached her side, most of the French
officers accepted the offer of safety and sprang into them.
Standing upon <i>L'Orient's</i> deck was the little ten-year-old
son of the Captain, named Casabianca, who was the favourite
of everyone on board, and as he made no attempt
to move, the British sailors shouted to him to come with
them.</p>

<p>"No," replied the boy; "my father told me to remain
here, and not to stir unless he called me."</p>

<p>"But," cried the sailors in amazement, "your father
lies mortally wounded on deck, and the ship will soon
blow up. Jump into the boat and save yourself."</p>

<p>"No," again responded the little fellow; "I must obey
my father's orders."</p>

<p>As there was no time to linger, the boat put off from
the ship's side. A few minutes later the figure of Casabianca
was seen in the glare of the flames, leaning over
the prostrate figure of his father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after, a terrible explosion shook every ship in
the bay, while burning fragments of <i>L'Orient</i> were hurled
in the air, falling heavily to the water in all directions.
A dead silence followed this fearful sound, and then the
British boats rowed busily about, picking up those who
had leapt from the burning vessel in time to save their
lives. In this way about seventy were saved. But where
was the brave boy, Casabianca? Not a sign of him was
to be seen. The noble lad had perished with his father,
faithful until death.</p>

</div>
<p>In the small German town of Halle there once lived
a barber-surgeon named George Handel. In those
days barbers were nearly always surgeons as well, and
George Handel was a very respected member of the profession.
He had a large family of sons and daughters,
the youngest of whom was called George Frederick.
When quite a small child this little fellow showed a
decided taste for music. In the nursery his only toys
were trumpets, drums, flutes, and anything out of which
he could get musical sounds. As he grew older this
intense love of music increased, until it became the one
great thought and pleasure of his life. Seeing this his
father was very distressed and alarmed, for he did not
wish his little son to take up music as the means of
earning his living.</p>

<p>At that time organists and musicians were very poorly
paid, and George Handel wanted his boy to get on well
in the world. So he tried to turn the child's mind away
from all such ideas, by never allowing him to go to any
place where music was performed, and by sending every
instrument out of his house. But in spite of so much
care and trouble taken, it was impossible to destroy the
strongest desire of the boy's nature.</p>

<p>One night, after the household had gone to bed, Mr.
Handel was awakened by the sound of soft music stealing
from an unused garret. He arose in great surprise,
and calling his wife they went to find out the cause of
these strange sounds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Going quietly to the garret they paused to listen outside
for a few moments, when their astonishment was increased
by the beauty of the melody which met their ears. Then,
opening the door and holding up the candle he carried,
George Handel peered wonderingly into the dusty old
lumber-room. There, seated at a clavichord (an instrument
something like a piano, only much smaller), was his little
son Frederick, then only six years old. The child had
coaxed one of his aunts, who was his friend and sympathizer,
to help him smuggle the clavichord into the
garret, where he taught himself to play while his parents
were asleep, or out of the house.</p>

<p>The wonderful sweetness of the music, together with
the earnest entreaties of the tiny performer, softened the
heart of his father to forgiveness of his conduct. But
even then the old gentleman could not be induced to
allow his son to follow the profession for which nature
had so well fitted him, as he feared he would not be able
to earn his living at it. However, it happened not long
after that the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels heard the boy
play, and was so struck by his genius that he persuaded
his parent to consent to have him properly trained.</p>

<p>When once he was enabled to continue his studies
under the guidance of a good master, it did not take
young Handel long to show not only his father, but the
whole world, that he was a truly great and marvellously
gifted musician. To-day his famous oratorios are played
everywhere, and people delight in them and marvel at them
just as much as when they were first produced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="The_Story_of_Columbus" id="The_Story_of_Columbus"></a>The Story of Columbus</h2>


<p>About four hundred years ago there lived an Italian
sailor, named Christopher Columbus. In those
days people supposed that there were no continents in
the world besides Europe, Asia, and Africa, but Columbus
believed there was a great country across the ocean that had
never been discovered. He felt a burning desire to sail in
search of this land, but as he was a poor man he had not the
money with which to get the necessary ships and men. For
some time he wandered from place to place trying to induce
others to help him carry out his plan, but he was only
laughed at and called a fool and a madman. At length
he obtained an interview with King Ferdinand and Queen
Isabella of Spain. At first they refused to give him any
assistance, but afterwards the Queen said she would pledge
her jewels to raise the needful money.</p>

<p>So in the month of August, Columbus sailed away
upon his voyage of discovery, his little fleet consisting of
three small vessels. For four weeks they sailed on
over the dark and stormy waters, during which time
Columbus had much trouble with his sailors, who grumbled
and complained unceasingly. When at length they found
themselves alone on the vast unknown seas, with no sign
of land, they became panic-stricken, and implored Columbus
to take them home again. He reproved them for their want
of courage. Then for a little while they showed a braver
spirit, but before long they again broke out into rebellion;
but Columbus was so strong-minded and courageous that
he succeeded in quelling the mutiny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus days passed, until one night, in the middle of
October, as Columbus was walking on deck he suddenly
saw a light ahead which told the sea-weary mariners that
the longed-for land must lie not far distant. When at
last dawn came it showed an island lying in the blue
waters before them. A boat was at once lowered, in
which Columbus and a party of his men landed upon
the unknown shore. Groups of dark-skinned natives
crowded to the water side, gazing in fear and wonder
at the strange white men. Then, with the Spanish royal
flag in one hand and his sword in the other, he took
possession of the island in the name of King Ferdinand
and Queen Isabella. Having visited other islands, Columbus
returned in triumph to Spain, where he was greeted
as a hero.</p>

</div>
<p>In the sunny land of Italy, in the obscure little village
of Possagno near Venice, there once lived a little lad
whose name was Antonio Canova. As he was left an
orphan at three years old he dwelt with his grandfather,
who earned his living by cutting figures and ornaments
out of stone. The old man took the greatest care of
his grandson and wished to train Antonio to become a
stone-cutter too, so with this end in view the boy was
taught drawing. He soon showed great talent, and when
he began to model birds and flowers in clay, he succeeded
so well that his grandfather was both astonished and
delighted. Even in his ninth year he made two beautiful
marble shrines which can be seen to this day.</p>

<p>One day a nobleman called Giovanni Falieri, who was
about to give a large dinner party, asked old Canova to
make him some ornament for the table. He said he did
not care what it was, but wanted something new and
uncommon. There was but little time before the date
fixed for the party, and the old stone-cutter tried in vain
to think of a suitable object. Seeing his grandfather so
troubled, Antonio said to him, "I think I can make
something to please his lordship. If you will let me have
some good hard butter I will make him a butter lion."</p>

<p>"That is an excellent idea," replied the old man. And
he sent for the butter at once.</p>

<p>Antonio set to work, and very soon he had shaped
a lion's head, with fine flowing mane, out of the creamy
mass. Then followed a beautifully formed body and limbs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">CANOVA&#39;S BUTTER LION</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>When the animal was complete his grandfather looked
at it with intense pride and admiration, and it was carefully
carried to his lordship. It attracted a great deal
of attention at the dinner party, and amid cries of wonderment
was passed from hand to hand. When the nobleman
and his guests heard that it was the work of a boy, they
expressed a great desire to see the talented young artist.
Antonio was sent for, and his lordship was so impressed
with his talent that he promised to see that he had the
best masters, and that he was given every chance to
succeed in his profession.</p>

<p>Giovanni Falieri nobly kept his word, and placed him
as a pupil under Bernardi, or as he is usually called
Torretti, a famous Venetian sculptor, who happened to
be staying in a neighbouring village at the time. By
the aid of this kind friend, and the power of his own
genius, Antonio became a world-renowned sculptor. And
not only was he a famous sculptor, but he was even entrusted
with great affairs of state.</p>

<p>When the great Napoleon conquered Italy he carried
off most unjustly hundreds of priceless works of art, and
when the tyrant was overthrown the young Canova was
sent as ambassador to Paris to find the whereabouts of
these works. For these and other services he was made
by the Pope Marquis of Ischia, and given a pension
of 3000 scudi. But Canova was very good and generous
and he devoted all this pension for the relief of his poor
brother artists. Thus the little figure of the butter lion
proved to be the stepping-stone to fame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Damon_and_Pythias" id="Damon_and_Pythias"></a>Damon and Pythias</h2>


<p>The city of Syracuse was once ruled over by a clever
but very cruel man called Dionysius. Perhaps he
would not have been so harsh and cruel if he had been
able to trust his people; but he knew that the Syracusans
hated him. It happened that he once suspected a certain
Greek called Pythias, and his anger was so terrible that
he sentenced the unfortunate man to death. Pythias begged
to be allowed to go and bid his relations in the country
farewell, promising to return at a given time to suffer the
death to which he had been condemned. Dionysius
laughed his request to scorn, saying that once he was
safely out of Syracuse it was not likely he would ever
return to die. Pythias replied that he had a friend,
named Damon, who would be answerable for his return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
at the given time. Damon then came forward and swore
that if Pythias did not keep his word, he himself would
suffer death in his stead. Dionysius consented to let
Pythias go.</p>

<p>Time went on and the day fixed for his return drew
near, but still he did not come. The Syracusans told
Damon that he would have to die for his faithless friend,
but Damon showed no anxiety. At length the very day
and hour upon which the condemned man was to die came
round. But a few minutes before the fatal time Pythias
rushed in, and having warmly embraced his friend, he
went forward to take his place. Dionysius was so struck
by the conduct of the two men that he pardoned Pythias,
and calling him and Damon to his side he entreated them
to allow him to be a third in their friendship.</p>

</div>
<p>Once the noble Charlemagne, King of the Franks,
was riding across a lonely moor with some of his
courtiers, when they were overtaken by a terrific storm.
It became so dark that the party lost sight of one another,
and the King found himself alone in the tempest of wind
and rain. As he struggled on he met a poor man leading
a horse with two great baskets upon its back.</p>

<p>"What is your name, friend?" enquired Charlemagne.</p>

<p>"I am Ralph, the charcoal-burner," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where I can find shelter for my
horse and myself?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"If you care to come with me to my cottage you will
be very welcome," answered Ralph.</p>

<p>The King was only too glad to accompany the man
to his house in the forest. When they reached the door
the charcoal-burner called to his wife to hasten to let them
in. Ralph stood aside for his companion to pass in first,
but Charlemagne hung back behind. Seeing this the man
took him by the neck and pushed him in the house, saying,
"It is only right that my guest should enter first."</p>

<p>When supper was ready the charcoal-burner bade King
Charlemagne go to the table before him. But again His
Majesty held back. Then Ralph gave his visitor such
a sound box on the ear that he staggered and fell.</p>

<p>"Why will you not do as I bid you?" he cried angrily.</p>

<p>"These are strange doings indeed," said the King to
himself, as he rose from the ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now tell me who you are, and where you live?"
said the peasant to his royal guest.</p>

<p>"My name is Uzmond, and I live at Court, where I
have an office with the Queen," replied Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Charlemagne before starting
offered to pay Ralph for his food and lodging, but the
man refused to take payment for sheltering one who belonged
to the Court of the noble King of France.</p>

<p>"So be it," answered His Majesty. "But if you will
not let me pay you, come to the Court with a load of
coals and I will see that you sell your goods."</p>

<p>"That will I do," answered Ralph.</p>

<p>The following day Ralph loaded his mare with two
large baskets of coal and set off to Court. When he
arrived there he asked for one Uzmond, but no one knew
of such a person. The King had given orders that he
should be admitted into the Palace, and at length he
came to a splendid hall, where Charlemagne sat at dinner
with his nobles. The poor charcoal-burner at once pointed
at His Majesty, exclaiming, "See, there sits Uzmond, but
truly he must be a greater man than he said!"</p>

<p>At this His Majesty burst into a loud laugh, and
rising from his seat he told the whole company how he
had fared at Ralph's cottage. The lords all laughed
heartily, but some of them would have had Ralph punished
for having boxed the King's ears.</p>

<p>"Nay," said Charlemagne, "Heaven forbid I should
harm him. He is an honest man who can strike a hard
blow, and I shall make him a knight instead."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
